# GitHub Actions Demo (for myself)
And anyone else that wants to see a stripped down example of GitHub actions working with SonarQube to create a CI pipeline that runs integration tests.

## Layout
The `client/redis` directory holds the targets for integration tests.  All of the other directories are targeted by unit tests. I may remove all but one of the unit testing targets to further simplify this repo.
